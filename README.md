# Battleships

This is my interpretation of the popular board game, battleships. It allows the player to challenge themselves against the computer, which randomly generates ships depending on the grid size chosen by the player. The player will try guess where all of the ships are hidden and if they manage to find them they win the game.
This battleships game is simple and easy to use for players of all ages. The simplicity of the programme results in quick, fun games.

## Features

### Existing/current Features

* Opening Message

    * This message welcomes the player to the game.
    * Asks the player to enter which size of grid they'd like to play on (this is essentially choosing the difficulty of the game).

* Rules

    * This section first congratulates the player for entering the grid size.
    * The rules then are to seek out all of the enemy ships.
    * If the user manages to find them all they win the game

* Grid and Co-ordinate Inputs

    * The grid is printed depending on the size the player entered.
    * The number of ships that are on the grid are then stated. 
    * The player is then asked for the row which they'd like to target.
    * Then the column they'd like to target.

* Game Outcomes 

    * If the player guesses where one of the ships are correctly they are congratulated.
    * If the player guesses incorrectly they are given a message saying they have missed.
    * The player repeats the guessing process until either all ships are sunk or they have used all of their shots.
    * If the player manages to sink all of the ships they are again congratulated on winning the game.
    * If the player uses all of their shots they are told better luck next time.

### Potential Future Features

* Boards for computer and player
    * This would mean that the player and computer would go head to head in order to see who can sink the others ships.
* Ship Placement
    * This would go hand in hand with the first potential feature. If the player had a board they could pick where they'd like to place their ships allowing it to be more immersive.
* Refresh grid instead of continuously printing it
    * This would mean the programme would all be on one screen and save the need for any scrolling. It would also make the game look alot cleaner and more presentable.
* Play again button
    * I would have liked to have added a button which would refresh the game and let the user play again. I however, didn't have enough time to do so.
