# Battleships

This is my interpretation of the popular board game, battleships. It allows the player to challenge themselves against the computer, which randomly generates ships depending on the grid size chosen by the player. The player will try guess where all of the ships are hidden and if they manage to find them they win the game.
This battleships game is simple and easy to use for players of all ages. The simplicity of the programme results in quick, fun games.

* Game Outcomes 

    * If the player guesses where one of the ships are correctly they are congratulated.
    * If the player guesses incorrectly they are given a message saying they have missed.
    * The player repeats the guessing process until either all ships are sunk or they have used all of their shots.
    * If the player manages to sink all of the ships they are again congratulated on winning the game.
    * If the player uses all of their shots they are told better luck next time.
