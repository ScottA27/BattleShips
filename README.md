# Battleships

This is my interpretation of the popular board game, battleships. It allows the player to challenge themselves against the computer, which randomly generates ships depending on the grid size chosen by the player. The player will try guess where all of the ships are hidden and if they manage to find them they win the game.
This battleships game is simple and easy to use for players of all ages. The simplicity of the programme results in quick, fun games.
